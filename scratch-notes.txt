IDs in Harvest are marked as "Integer" - however JSON doesn't clearly define what an integer is (beyond a whole number).

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13502398/json-integers-limit-on-size

It looks like the defacto definition is -(2^53 + 1) to 2^53 + 1


https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/langCon_apex_primitives.htm

Integer in SF is -(2^31 + 1) through to 2^31 - 1
This should be enough, but we cannot be sure!
Harvest API doesn't define an Integer value!

Long is a better choice: -(2^63 + 1) through to 2^63 - 1

But SF Objects use "Number" or "Text"

With number formatting, may be best to use text and control input to it

No, we can use Number with 18 digits and 0 decimal places - more than enough


On Harvest ID entries:

Listed as Integer by Harvest API v2

Should be Number(18,0)

Consideration for enabling audit fields - https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=Considerations-before-having-Create-Audit-Fields-enabled&language=en_US&type=1

Permissions Required to set Audit Fields: "Modify All Data"

- Use a permission set to contain the data import user permissions

Task in app and Harvest is called "Time Tracker Task"

NOTE: I did not map to the Standard SF "Task" object. The behaviour of this object is different to the specifications as well as Harvest's view of a Task. So, I have called the custom object in SalesForce a "Time Tracker Task"

invoice   object   Once the time entry has been invoiced, this field will include the associated invoiceâ€™s id and number.

BETA field warning

Time Custom Field (Beta)

Started Time and Ended Time on the Time Entry object is a Time custom field.

NOTE: This is a new object field type and is still marked as BETA.

Created At and Updated At field

Many of the Harvest API data models include "Created At" and "Updated At" fields, these relate to the SF admin fields. They may be populated by Data Loading.

ACCOUNT AND CONTACT (Harvest: Clients and Client Contacts)

However, on the Account and contact standard SF Objects I have included them as separate fields.

Discussion needed if these should use the SF Admin fields or not.
